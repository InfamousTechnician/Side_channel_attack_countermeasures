# Side channel attack countermeasures

* masked_AND_by_me contains paramaterizable code to calculate "AND" between arbitrary many masked shares of two words of arbitrary bit widths. I discovered this function while studiing side channel attacks. It has NOT been proven SCA proof!! The function calculates Ci-s by "AND"-ing the corresponding bits Ai and Bi, and correcting this with the parities of all the other bits Aj and Bj, where j<>i by "AND"-ing the parities and XOR-ing this to the Ai&Bi product.
** and_offset.py may already be SCA proof, in fact hopefully it is a threshold implementation, with more or less randomly shufflable computations, that make analysis more noisy, if the attacker doesn't know which piece of trace belongs to which share, and thus has to sum up traces and calculate with those algorithmically noisy results
